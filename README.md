> Where are homeworks 1-2?

I did these on paper before discovering the magic of GitHub flavored Markdown with $\LaTeX$.

> Where are quizzes 1-3?

All quizzes were in person except for quiz 4 which was assigned during "dead/prep week" when we didn't have class. so it was assigned online.

> Are my answers correct?

Most of them are, but I am a student and make mistakes too.
