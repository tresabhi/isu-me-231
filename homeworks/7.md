> A rigid tank of volume 2 m3 contains air at 0.21 bar, 290 K. A leak develops and air flows in slowly from the surroundings, which are at 1.1 bar, 312 K. After a while, the tank and its surroundings come to equilibrium. What is the final temperature in the tank, in °C, and how much mass has entered the tank, in kg? Neglect kinetic and potential energy effects and assume the air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats evaluated at 300 K.

$$
V=2m^3
$$

$$
p_1=0.21bar
$$

$$
T_1=290K
$$

$$
p_\infty=1.1bar
$$

$$
T_\infty=312K
$$

From table A-20 for air where $T=300K$:

$$
c_p=1.005\frac{kJ}{kg*K}
$$

$$
c_v=0.718\frac{kJ}{kg*K}
$$

$$
k=1.400
$$

Since the pressure reaches equilibrium with the environment (but the same cannot be said for the temperature),

$$
p_2=p_\infty=1.1bar
$$

I will be leveraging the equilibrium equation:

$$
Q-W+m_{in}(h_{in}+\frac{1}{2}V_{in}^2+gz_{in})-m_{out}(h_{out}+\frac{1}{2}V_{out}^2+gz_{out})=E_2-E_1
$$

A significant portion of the equation is either $0$ or negligible:

$$
m_{in}h_{in}=E_2-E_1
$$

A few substitutes can be made incrementally. The energy of both states is entirely composed of internal energy because everything else is ignored:

$$
m_{in}h_{in}=m_2u_2-m_1u_1
$$

Substitutions using specific heats:

$$
m_{in}c_pT_\infty=m_2u_2-m_1u_1
$$

$$
m_{in}c_pT_\infty=m_2c_vT_2-m_1c_vT_1
$$

Here are the knowns (underlined) for now with $T_2$ being the target value I wish to acquire:

$$
m_{in}\underline{c_pT_\infty}=m_2\underline{c_v}T_2-m_1\underline{c_vT_1}
$$

Mass of state $1$ can be acquired using the ideal gas equation of state. From table A-1 for air:

$$
M=28.97\frac{kg}{kmol}
$$

$$
\bar{R}=8.3145\frac{J}{mol*K}
$$

$$
R=\frac{\bar{R}}{M}=\frac{8.3145\frac{J}{mol*K}}{28.97\frac{kg}{kmol}}=287\frac{J}{kg*K}
$$

$$
pV=mRT
$$

$$
m=\frac{pV}{RT}
$$

$$
m_1=\frac{p_1V}{RT_1}=\frac{0.21bar * 2m^3}{287\frac{J}{kg*K} * 290K}=0.505kg
$$

By computing $m_1$, the number of unknowns is even lower now:

$$
m_{in}\underline{c_pT_\infty}=m_2\underline{c_v}T_2-\underline{m_1c_vT_1}
$$

$m_{in}$ can be calculated right away too by leveraging the fact that $T_2$ cancels out when the ideal gas law is substituted into the equilibrium equation:

$$
p_2V=m_2RT_2
$$

$$
m_2=\frac{p_2V}{RT_2}
$$

$$
m_2=\frac{p_2V}{RT_2}
$$

$$
m_{in}c_pT_\infty=m_2c_vT_2-m_1c_vT_1
$$

$$
m_{in}c_pT_\infty=\frac{p_2V}{RT_2}*c_vT_2-m_1c_vT_1
$$

$$
m_{in}c_pT_\infty=\frac{p_2Vc_v}{R}-m_1c_vT_1
$$

Solving for $m_{in}$ gets a little messy which is exactly why I use $\LaTeX$ lol:

$$
m_{in}=\frac{\frac{p_2Vc_v}{R}-m_1c_vT_1}{c_pT_\infty}=\frac{\frac{1.1bar * 2m^3 * 0.718\frac{kJ}{kg*K}}{287\frac{J}{kg*K}}-0.505kg * 0.718\frac{kJ}{kg*K} * 290K}{1.005\frac{kJ}{kg*K} * 312K}=\boxed{1.42kg}
$$

Lastly, $m_{in}$ and $m_2$ are related where $m_{out}=0$ because nothing leaves the container:

$$
m_{in}-m_{out}=m_2-m_1
$$

$$
m_{in}=m_2-m_1
$$

$$
m_2=m_{in}+m_1=1.42kg + 0.505kg=1.93kg
$$

Now everything but $T_2$ is known in the equilibrium equation; hence, $T_2$ can be solved for:

$$
m_{in}c_pT_\infty=m_2c_vT_2-m_1c_vT_1
$$

$$
m_{in}c_pT_\infty+m_1c_vT_1=m_2c_vT_2
$$

$$
T_2=\frac{m_{in}c_pT_\infty+m_1c_vT_1}{m_2c_v}
$$

$$
T_2=\frac{1.42kg * 1.005\frac{kJ}{kg*K} * 312K + 0.505kg * 0.718\frac{kJ}{kg*K} * 290K}{1.93kg * 0.718\frac{kJ}{kg*K}}=\boxed{397.2K}
$$

I supposed it makes sense for it to be warmer ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
