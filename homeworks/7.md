> A rigid tank of volume 2 m3 contains air at 0.21 bar, 290 K. A leak develops and air flows in slowly from the surroundings, which are at 1.1 bar, 312 K. After a while, the tank and its surroundings come to equilibrium. What is the final temperature in the tank, in Â°C, and how much mass has entered the tank, in kg? Neglect kinetic and potential energy effects and assume the air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats evaluated at 300 K.

$$
V=2m^3
$$

$$
p_1=0.21bar
$$

$$
T_1=290K
$$

$$
p_\infty=1.1bar
$$

$$
T_\infty=312K
$$

Since the problem explicitly states the air inside reaches equilibrium with the surroundings, both the air inside and outside will share the same properties:

$$
T_2=T_\infty=312K
$$

$$
p_2=p_\infty=1.1bar
$$

The temperature of the second state can now be converted to celsius:

$$
T_2=\boxed{38.9\degree C}
$$

From table A-1 for air:

$$
M=28.97\frac{kg}{kmol}
$$

$$
\bar{R}=8.3145\frac{J}{mol*K}
$$

$$
R=\frac{\bar{R}}{M}=\frac{8.3145\frac{J}{mol*K}}{28.97\frac{kg}{kmol}}=287\frac{J}{kg*K}
$$

$$
pV=mRT
$$

$$
m=\frac{pV}{RT}
$$

$$
m_1=\frac{p_1V}{RT_1}=\frac{0.21bar * 2m^3}{287\frac{J}{kg*K} * 290K}=0.505kg
$$

$$
m_2=\frac{p_2V}{RT_2}=\frac{1.1bar * 2m^3}{287\frac{J}{kg*K} * 312K}=2.46kg
$$

$$
m_{in}-m_{out}=m_{2}-m_{1}
$$

Since no mass leaves:

$$
m_{in}=m_{2}-m_{1}=2.46kg-0.505kg=\boxed{1.96kg}
$$
