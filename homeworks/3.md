# ME 231 HW 3

Hello, grader of my homework! In order to preserve my sanity, I am moving away from writing most of my homeworks for most classes on paper/Google Docs. I am now trying out Markdown and $\LaTeX$ with the GitHub flavor so my homeworks should be prettier for you and easier for me to write.

> A closed, rigid tank contains Refrigerant 134a, initially at 100Â°C. The refrigerant is cooled until it becomes saturated vapor at 20Â°C. For the refrigerant, determine the initial and final pressures, each in bar, and the heat transfer, in kJ/kg. Kinetic and potential energy effects can be ignored.

From table A-10 with $T_2=20\degree$:

$\boxed{P_2=5.7160bar}$

$u_2=u_{2g}=237.91kJ/kg$

The total specific volume is constant.

$v_1=v_2=v_{2g}=0.0358m^3/kg$

From table A-10 with $T_1=100\degree$:

$v_{1f}=1.5443*10^{-3}m^3/kg=0.0015443m^3/kg$

$v_{1g}=0.0027m^3/kg$

$v_1>v_{1g}$

The liquid at $100\degree$ is superheated.

Two entries from table A-12 with $T=100\degree$ surrounding our target $v=0.0358m^3/kg$:

| $P$      | $v$             | $u$           |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| $7.0bar$ | $0.04064m^3/kg$ | $309.74kJ/kg$ |
| $8.0bar$ | $0.03519m^3/kg$ | $308.93kJ/kg$ |

Interpolation time ğŸ˜¨

$P_1=7.00bar+(8.0bar-7.00bar)\frac{0.0358m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}{0.03519m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}=\boxed{7.89bar}$

$u_1=309.74kJ/kg+(308.93kJ/kg-309.74kJ/kg)\frac{0.0358m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}{0.03519m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}=309kJ/kg$

Now specific $Q$ can be solved for.

$\Delta U=Q-\cancel{W}$

$Q=\Delta U=U_2-U_1=m(u_2-u_1)$

$Q/m=u_2-u_1=237.91kJ/kg-309kJ/kg=\boxed{-71.1kJ/kg}$
