# ME 231 HW 3

Hello, grader of my homework! In order to preserve my sanity, I am moving away from writing most of my homeworks for most classes on paper/Google Docs. I am now trying out Markdown and $\LaTeX$ with the GitHub flavor so my homeworks should be prettier for you and easier for me to write.

## 3.33

> A closed, rigid tank contains Refrigerant 134a, initially at 100Â°C. The refrigerant is cooled until it becomes saturated vapor at 20Â°C. For the refrigerant, determine the initial and final pressures, each in bar, and the heat transfer, in kJ/kg. Kinetic and potential energy effects can be ignored.

From table A-10 with $T_2=20\degree C$:

$\boxed{P_2=5.7160bar}$

$u_2=u_{2g}=237.91kJ/kg$

The total specific volume is constant.

$v_1=v_2=v_{2g}=0.0358m^3/kg$

From table A-10 with $T_1=100\degree C$:

$v_{1f}=1.5443*10^{-3}m^3/kg=0.0015443m^3/kg$

$v_{1g}=0.0027m^3/kg$

$v_1>v_{1g}$

The liquid at $100\degree C$ is superheated.

Two entries from table A-12 with $T=100\degree C$ surrounding my target $v=0.0358m^3/kg$:

| $P$      | $v$             | $u$           |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| $7.0bar$ | $0.04064m^3/kg$ | $309.74kJ/kg$ |
| $8.0bar$ | $0.03519m^3/kg$ | $308.93kJ/kg$ |

Interpolation time ðŸ˜¨

$P_1=7.00bar+(8.0bar-7.00bar)\frac{0.0358m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}{0.03519m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}=\boxed{7.89bar}$

$u_1=309.74kJ/kg+(308.93kJ/kg-309.74kJ/kg)\frac{0.0358m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}{0.03519m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}=309kJ/kg$

Now specific $Q$ can be solved for.

$\Delta U=Q-\cancel{W}$

$Q=\Delta U=U_2-U_1=m(u_2-u_1)$

$Q/m=u_2-u_1=237.91kJ/kg-309kJ/kg=\boxed{-71.1kJ/kg}$

## 3.40

> A pistonâ€“cylinder assembly contains water, initially a saturated vapor at 200Â°C. The water is cooled at constant temperature to saturated liquid. Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible.
>
> a. For the water as a closed system, determine the work per unit mass of water, in kJ/kg.
>
> b. If the energy transfer by heat for the process is âˆ’1200 kJ, determine the mass of the water, in kg.

$T_1=T_2=200\degree C$

From table A-2 with $T_1=200\degree C$:

$u_1=u_{1g}=2595.3kJ/kg$

$u_2=u_{2f}=850.65kJ/kg$

$Q/m=u_2-u_1=850.65kJ/kg-2595.3kJ/kg=\boxed{-1745kJ/kg}$ (a)

$Q/m=-1745kJ/kg$

$m=\frac{Q}{-1745kJ/kg}=\frac{âˆ’1200kJ}{-1745kJ/kg}=\boxed{0.688kg}$ (b)

## 3.43

> A closed, rigid tank filled with water, initially at 20 bar, a quality of 80%, and a volume of 0.5 m3, is cooled until the pressure is 4 bar. Show the process of the water on a sketch of the Tâ€“Ï… diagram and evaluate the heat transfer, in kJ.

$P_1=20bar$

$x_1=80\%$

$V_1=0.5m^3$

$P_2=4bar$

From table A-3 with $P=20bar$

$v_{1f}=1.1767*10^{-3}m^3/kg$

$v_{1g}=0.09963m^3/kg$

$u_{1f}=906.44kJ/kg$

$u_{1g}=2600.3kJ/kg$

$v_1=v_f+x(v_g-v_f)$

$v_1=1.1767*10^{-3}m^3/kg+(80\%)(0.09963m^3/kg-1.1767*10^{-3}m^3/kg)$

$v_1=0.079939m^3/kg$

$u_1=906.44kJ/kg+(80\%)(2600.3kJ/kg-906.44kJ/kg)$

$u_1=2261.5kJ/kg$

Now solving for $m$ which I will use later to multiply with specific heat to get heat just in $kJ$.

$v_1=V_1/m$

$m=\frac{V_1}{v_1}=\frac{0.5m^3}{0.079939m^3/kg}=6.25kg$

Now I need $u_2$ and because it's a rigid tank, the specific volume is constant.

$v_2=v_1=0.079939m^3/kg$

From table A-3 with $P=4bar$

$v_{2f}=1.0836*10^{-3}m^3/kg=0.0010836m^3/kg$

$v_{2g}=0.4625m^3/kg$

$u_{2f}=604.31kJ/kg$

$u_{2g}=2553.6kJ/kg$

$v_{2f}<v_2<v_{2g}$

The second state of the liquid is partially saturated. This should allow me to calculate the quality and then the later the specific energy for state 2 after which I will have access to specific energies of both states and also the mass from above.

$x_2=\frac{v_2-v_{2f}}{v_{2g}-v_{2f}}*100\%=\frac{0.079939m^3/kg-1.0836*10^{-3}m^3/kg}{0.4625m^3/kg-1.0836*10^{-3}m^3/kg}*100\%=17.09\%$

$u_2=u_{2f}+x_2(u_{2g}-u_{2f})$

$u_2=604.31kJ/kg+(17.09\%)(2553.6kJ/kg-604.31kJ/kg)=937.4kJ/kg$

And now everything comes together.

$Q=\Delta U+\cancel{W}=\Delta U=U_2-U_1=m(u_2-u_1)$

$Q=6.25kg*(937.4kJ/kg-2261.5kJ/kg)=\boxed{-8280kJ}$

_I may be able to write pretty now, but drawing... that's a different story._

## 3.56

> A pistonâ€“cylinder assembly contains propane, initially at 27Â°C, 1 bar, and a volume of 0.2 m3. The propane undergoes a process to a final pressure of 4 bar, during which the pressureâ€“volume relationship is pV1.1 = constant. For the propane, evaluate the work and heat transfer, each in kJ. Kinetic and potential energy effects can be ignored.

$T_1=27\degree C$

$p_1=1bar$

$V_1=0.2m^3$

$p_2=4bar$

$pV^{1.1}=\text{const}$

It's a polytropic process.

$n=1.1$

$p_1V_1^{1.1}=p_2V_2^{1.1}$

$\frac{p_1V_1^{1.1}}{p_2}=V_2^{1.1}$

$V_2=\left(\frac{p_1V_1^{1.1}}{p_2}\right)^{\frac{1}{1.1}}=\left(\frac{1bar*(0.2m^3)^{1.1}}{4bar}\right)^{\frac{1}{1.1}}=0.05672m^3$

$W=\frac{p_2V_2-p_1V_1}{1-n}=\frac{4bar*0.05672m^3-1bar*0.2m^3}{1-1.1}=\boxed{-26.86kJ}$

Now for the heat transfer.

$\Delta U=Q-W$

$Q=\Delta U+W=m(\Delta u)+W=m(u_2-u_1)+W$

$W$ is known and I can get specific energy for both states. So what I really need now is mass. Assuming ideal gas law, I should be able to get $m$.

$R=\frac{\bar{R}}{M}=\frac{8.3144598J/(K*mol)}{44.09kg/kmol}=188.58J/(kg*K)$

$PV=mRT$

$P_1V_1=mRT_1$

$m=\frac{P_1V_1}{R_1T_1}=\frac{1bar*0.2m^3}{188.58J/(kg*K)*27\degree C}=0.353kg$

Specific internal energies of state 1 from table A-18 with $p=1bar$ around my target $T=27\degree C$

| $T$           | $u$          |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| $20\degree C$ | $463.3kJ/kg$ |
| $30\degree C$ | $478.2kJ/kg$ |

$u_1=463.3kJ/kg+(478.2kJ/kg-463.3kJ/kg)\frac{30\degree C-27\degree C}{30\degree C-20\degree C}=467.77kJ/kg$

Before I can get the specific internal temperature of state 2, I need the temperature of state 2.

$P_2V_2=mRT_2$

$T_2=\frac{P_2V_2}{mR}=\frac{4bar*0.05672m^3}{0.353kg*188.58J/(kg*K)}=340.8K=67.65\degree C$

Specific internal energies of state 2 from table A-18 with $p=4bar$ around my target $T=67.65\degree C$

| $T$           | $u$          |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| $60\degree C$ | $521.1kJ/kg$ |
| $70\degree C$ | $538.1kJ/kg$ |

$u_2=521.1kJ/kg+(538.1kJ/kg-521.1kJ/kg)\frac{70\degree C-67.65\degree C}{70\degree C-60\degree C}=525.1kJ/kg$

Now it all comes together.

$Q=m(u_2-u_1)+W=0.353kg*(525.1kJ/kg-467.77kJ/kg)+(-26.86kJ)=\boxed{-6.62kJ}$
