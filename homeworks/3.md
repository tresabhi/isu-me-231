# ME 231 HW 3

Hello, grader of my homework! In order to preserve my sanity, I am moving away from writing most of my homeworks for most classes on paper/Google Docs. I am now trying out Markdown and $\LaTeX$ with the GitHub flavor so my homeworks should be prettier for you and easier for me to write.

## 3.33

> A closed, rigid tank contains Refrigerant 134a, initially at 100Â°C. The refrigerant is cooled until it becomes saturated vapor at 20Â°C. For the refrigerant, determine the initial and final pressures, each in bar, and the heat transfer, in kJ/kg. Kinetic and potential energy effects can be ignored.

From table A-10 with $T_2=20\degree$:

$\boxed{P_2=5.7160bar}$

$u_2=u_{2g}=237.91kJ/kg$

The total specific volume is constant.

$v_1=v_2=v_{2g}=0.0358m^3/kg$

From table A-10 with $T_1=100\degree$:

$v_{1f}=1.5443*10^{-3}m^3/kg=0.0015443m^3/kg$

$v_{1g}=0.0027m^3/kg$

$v_1>v_{1g}$

The liquid at $100\degree$ is superheated.

Two entries from table A-12 with $T=100\degree$ surrounding my target $v=0.0358m^3/kg$:

| $P$      | $v$             | $u$           |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| $7.0bar$ | $0.04064m^3/kg$ | $309.74kJ/kg$ |
| $8.0bar$ | $0.03519m^3/kg$ | $308.93kJ/kg$ |

Interpolation time ðŸ˜¨

$P_1=7.00bar+(8.0bar-7.00bar)\frac{0.0358m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}{0.03519m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}=\boxed{7.89bar}$

$u_1=309.74kJ/kg+(308.93kJ/kg-309.74kJ/kg)\frac{0.0358m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}{0.03519m^3/kg-0.04064m^3/kg}=309kJ/kg$

Now specific $Q$ can be solved for.

$\Delta U=Q-\cancel{W}$

$Q=\Delta U=U_2-U_1=m(u_2-u_1)$

$Q/m=u_2-u_1=237.91kJ/kg-309kJ/kg=\boxed{-71.1kJ/kg}$

## 3.40

> A pistonâ€“cylinder assembly contains water, initially a saturated vapor at 200Â°C. The water is cooled at constant temperature to saturated liquid. Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible.
>
> a. For the water as a closed system, determine the work per unit mass of water, in kJ/kg.
>
> b. If the energy transfer by heat for the process is âˆ’1200 kJ, determine the mass of the water, in kg.

$T_1=T_2=200\degree$

From table A-2 with $T_1=200\degree$:

$u_1=u_{1g}=2595.3kJ/kg$

$u_2=u_{2f}=850.65kJ/kg$

$Q/m=u_2-u_1=850.65kJ/kg-2595.3kJ/kg=\boxed{-1745kJ/kg}$ (a)

$Q/m=-1745kJ/kg$

$m=\frac{Q}{-1745kJ/kg}=\frac{âˆ’1200kJ}{-1745kJ/kg}=\boxed{0.688kg}$ (b)

## 3.43

> A closed, rigid tank filled with water, initially at 20 bar, a quality of 80%, and a volume of 0.5 m3, is cooled until the pressure is 4 bar. Show the process of the water on a sketch of the Tâ€“Ï… diagram and evaluate the heat transfer, in kJ.

$P_1=20bar$

$x_1=80\%$

$V_1=0.5m^3$

$P_2=4bar$

From table A-3 with $P=20bar$

$v_{1f}=1.1767*10^{-3}m^3/kg$

$v_{1g}=0.09963m^3/kg$

$u_{1f}=906.44kJ/kg$

$u_{1g}=2600.3kJ/kg$

$v_1=v_f+x(v_g-v_f)$

$v_1=1.1767*10^{-3}m^3/kg+(80\%)(0.09963m^3/kg-1.1767*10^{-3}m^3/kg)$

$v_1=0.079939m^3/kg$

$u_1=906.44kJ/kg+(80\%)(2600.3kJ/kg-906.44kJ/kg)$

$u_1=2261.5kJ/kg$

Now solving for $m$ which I will use later to multiply with specific heat to get heat just in $kJ$.

$v_1=V_1/m$

$m=\frac{V_1}{v_1}=\frac{0.5m^3}{0.079939m^3/kg}=6.25kg$

Now I need $u_2$ and because it's a rigid tank, the specific volume is constant.

$v_2=v_1=0.079939m^3/kg$

From table A-3 with $P=4bar$

$v_{2f}=1.0836*10^{-3}m^3/kg=0.0010836m^3/kg$

$v_{2g}=0.4625m^3/kg$

$u_{2f}=604.31kJ/kg$

$u_{2g}=2553.6kJ/kg$

$v_{2f}<v_2<v_{2g}$

The second state of the liquid is partially saturated. This should allow me to calculate the quality and then the later the specific energy for state 2 after which I will have access to specific energies of both states and also the mass from above.

$x_2=\frac{v_2-v_{2f}}{v_{2g}-v_{2f}}*100\%=\frac{0.079939m^3/kg-1.0836*10^{-3}m^3/kg}{0.4625m^3/kg-1.0836*10^{-3}m^3/kg}*100\%=17.09\%$

$u_2=u_{2f}+x_2(u_{2g}-u_{2f})$

$u_2=604.31kJ/kg+(17.09\%)(2553.6kJ/kg-604.31kJ/kg)=937.4kJ/kg$

And now everything comes together.

$Q=\Delta U+\cancel{W}=\Delta U=U_2-U_1=m(u_2-u_1)$

$Q=6.25kg*(937.4kJ/kg-2261.5kJ/kg)=\boxed{-8280kJ}$

_I may be able to write pretty now but drawing... that's a different story._
