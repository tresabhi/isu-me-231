## 5.14

> A power cycle receives QH by heat transfer from a hot reservoir at TH = 1200 K and rejects energy QC by heat transfer to a cold reservoir at TC = 400 K. For each of the following cases, determine whether the cycle operates reversibly, operates irreversibly, or is impossible.
>
> a. QH = 900 kJ, Wcycle = 450 kJ
>
> b. QH = 900 kJ, QC = 300 kJ
>
> c. Wcycle = 600 kJ, QC = 400 kJ
>
> d. η = 75%

## 5.19

> At a particular location, magma exists several kilometers below Earth's surface at a temperature of 1100°C, while the average temperature of the atmosphere at the surface is 15°C. An inventor claims to have devised a power cycle operating between these temperatures having a thermal efficiency of 79%. Investigate this claim.

## 5.31

> At steady state, a reversible refrigeration cycle discharges energy at the rate 𝑄H to a hot reservoir at temperature TH, while receiving energy at the rate 𝑄C from a cold reservoir at temperature TC.
>
> a. If TH = 13°C and TC = 2°C, determine the coefficient of performance.
>
> b. If 𝑄H = 10.5 kW, 𝑄C = 8.75 kW, and TC = 0°C, determine TH, in °C.
>
> c. If the coefficient of performance is 10 and TH = 27°C, determine TC, in °C.

## 5.59

> At steady state, a thermodynamic cycle operating between hot and cold reservoirs at 1000 K and 500 K, respectively, receives energy by heat transfer from the hot reservoir at a rate of 1500 kW, discharges energy by heat transfer to the cold reservoir, and develops power at a rate of (a) 1000 kW, (b) 750 kW, (c) 0 kW. For each case, apply Eq. 5.13 on a time-rate basis to determine whether the cycle operates reversibly, operates irreversibly, or is impossible.
