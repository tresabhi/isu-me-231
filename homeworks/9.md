Assuming the ideal gas model for the air, and ignoring kinetic and potential energy, determine (a) the final pressure, in bar, (b) the work, in kJ, and (c) the amount of entropy produced, in kJ/K. Solve using

$$
\dot{W}=0

$$
\dot{Q}=0
$$

$$
T_1=300K
$$

$$
p_1=2bar
$$

$$
V=2m^3
$$

$$
T_2=500K
$$

### a.

The pressure fo the second state can be fetched using the ideal gas law:

$$
pV=mRT
$$

$$
\frac{pV}{T}=mR
$$

$$
\frac{p}{T}=\frac{mR}{V}=\text{const}=\frac{p_1}{T_1}=\frac{p_2}{T_2}
$$

$$
p_2=\frac{p_1 T_2}{T_1}=\frac{2bar * 500K}{300K}=\boxed{3.333bar}
$$

$$
Q-W=\Delta E=\Delta U
$$

$$
-W=\Delta U=U_2-U_1=m(u_2-u_1)
$$

From table A-22 where $T=300K$

$$
u_1=214.07\frac{kJ}{kg}
$$

$u_2$ must be found using interpolation. Excerpt from table A-22:

| $T$    | $u$                   |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| $440K$ | $315.30\frac{kJ}{kg}$ |
| $750K$ | $551.99\frac{kJ}{kg}$ |

$$
u_2=315.30+(551.99-315.30)\frac{500-440}{750-440}=361.11\frac{kJ}{kg}
$$

From table A-1 for air:

$$
M=28.97\frac{kg}{kmol}
$$

$$
\bar{R}=8.3145\frac{J}{mol*K}
$$

$$
R=\frac{\bar{R}}{M}=\frac{8.3145\frac{J}{mol*K}}{28.97\frac{kg}{kmol}}=287\frac{J}{kg*K}
$$

$$
pV=mRT
$$

$$
p_1V=mRT_1
$$

$$
m=\frac{p_1V}{RT_1}=\frac{2bar*2m^3}{287\frac{J}{kg*K} * 300K}=4.646kg
$$

$$
W=-m(u_2-u_1)=-4.646kg * (361.11\frac{kJ}{kg} - 214.07\frac{kJ}{kg})=\boxed{-683.1kJ}
$$

A negative answer for $W$ makes sense because work was done to the system.

From table A-22:

$$
s\degree(T_1)=s\degree(300K)=1.70203\frac{kJ}{kg*K}
$$

$s\degree(T_2)$ must be found using interpolation. Excerpt from table A-22:

| $T$    | $s\degree(T)$            |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| $440K$ | $2.08870\frac{kJ}{kg*K}$ |
| $750K$ | $2.64737\frac{kJ}{kg*K}$ |

$$
s\degree(T_2)=s\degree(500K)=2.08870+(2.64737-2.08870)\frac{500-440}{750-440}=2.19683\frac{kJ}{kg*K}
$$

$$
\Delta S = \frac{\partial Q}{T} + \Delta \sigma
$$

$$
\Delta \sigma = \Delta S = S_2-S_1=S\degree(T_2)-S\degree(T_1)-R \ln \frac{p_2}{p_1}
$$

$$
\Delta \sigma=m(s\degree(T_2)-s\degree(T_1)-R \ln \frac{p_2}{p_1})
$$

$$
\Delta \sigma=4.646kg * \left(2.19683\frac{kJ}{kg*K}-1.70203\frac{kJ}{kg*K}-287\frac{J}{kg*K} * \ln \frac{3.333bar}{2bar}\right)=\boxed{1.618kJ/K}
$$

### b.

From table A-20 where $T=400K$ for air:

$$
c_v=0.726\frac{kJ}{kg*K}
$$

Regardless of a constant $c_v$, I would use the ideal gas law equation the same way to find $p_2$ (thus $m$ too) as in part (a).

$$
p_2=\boxed{3.333bar}
$$

$$
m=4.646kg
$$

$$
Q-W=\Delta E=\Delta U
$$

$$
-W=\Delta U=m c_v (T_2 - T_1)
$$

$$
W=\Delta U=- m c_v (T_2 - T_1)=- 4.646kg * 0.726\frac{kJ}{kg*K} (500K - 300K)=\boxed{-674.6kJ}
$$

That's pretty close!

$$
\sigma=S_2-S_1=m(s_2-s_1)=m(c_v \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1} + R \ln \frac{V}{V})=m c_v \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1}=4.646kg * 0.726\frac{kJ}{kg*K} \ln \frac{500K}{300K}
$$

$$
\sigma=\boxed{1.723kJ/K}
$$

Also pretty dang close! But I would trust part (a) more lol.

> Steam undergoes an adiabatic expansion in a piston–cylinder assembly from 100 bar, 360°C to 1 bar, 160°C. What is work in kJ per kg of steam for the process? Calculate the amount of entropy produced, in kJ/K per kg of steam. What is the maximum theoretical work that could be obtained from the given initial state to the same final pressure? Show both processes on a properly labeled sketch of the T–s diagram.

## 6.60

> Air at 400 kPa, 980 K enters a turbine operating at steady state and exits at 100 kPa, 670 K. Heat transfer from the turbine occurs at an average outer surface temperature of 315 K at the rate of 30 kJ per kg of air flowing. Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible. Assuming the air is modeled as an ideal gas with variations in specific heat, determine (a) the rate power is developed, in kJ per kg of air flowing, and (b) the rate of entropy production within the turbine, in kJ/K per kg of air flowing.
