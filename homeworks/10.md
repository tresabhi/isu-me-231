> Air in a piston-cylinder assembly is compressed isentropically from state 1, where T1 = 35°C, to state 2, where the specific volume is one-tenth of the specific volume at state 1. Applying the ideal gas model and assuming variations in specific heat, determine (a) T2, in °C, and (b) the work, in kJ/kg.

$$
T_1=35\degree C
$$

$$
v_2=\frac{1}{10}v_1
$$

From table A-22 with $T_1=35\degree C=308.15K\approx310K$:

$$
v_{r1}=572.3
$$

$$
h_1=310.24kJ/kg
$$

$$
\frac{v_{r2}}{v_{r1}}=\frac{v_2}{v_1}
$$

$$
v_{r2}=\frac{v_2 v_{r1}}{v_1}
$$

$$
v_{r2}=\frac{\frac{1}{10}v_1 v_{r1}}{v_1}
$$

$$
v_{r2}=\frac{v_{r1}}{10}
$$

$$
v_{r2}=\frac{v_{r1}}{10}=\frac{572.3}{10}=57.23
$$

From table A-22 with $v_r=57.23\approx57.63$:

$$
T_2=750K=\boxed{476.85\degree C}
$$

$$
h_2=767.29kJ/kg
$$

$$
w=h_2-h_1=767.29kJ/kg-310.24kJ/kg=\boxed{457.15kJ/kg}
$$

> Water vapor at 5 bar, 320°C enters a turbine operating at steady state with a volumetric flow rate of 0.65 m3/s and expands adiabatically to an exit state of 1 bar, 160°C. Kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible. Determine for the turbine (a) the power developed, in kW, (b) the rate of entropy production, in kW/K, and (c) the isentropic turbine efficiency.

## 6.98

> Air enters the compressor of a gas turbine power plant operating at steady state at 290 K, 100 kPa and exits at 330 kPa. Stray heat transfer and kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible. The isentropic compressor efficiency is 90.3%. Using the ideal gas model for air, determine the work input, in kJ per kg of air flowing.
